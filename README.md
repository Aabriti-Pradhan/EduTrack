Java Spring project using JDBC and CRUD operations.
I used core spring concepts like Dependency Injection and Inversion of control, which use annotations like @Component and @Autowired.
I also connected my project to a real MySQL database via application.properties.
I used CRUD operations to alter the table of my MySQL database.

This project is completely console-based and was completed within a day.
The purpose behind this project was for me to learn Spring dependencies and the integration of JDBC.
